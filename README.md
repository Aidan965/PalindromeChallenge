# CME Group - Graduate Software Engineer Palindrome Challenge


    PalindromeChallenge/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/words.txt contains the persistence of palindrome words.


Assumption(s) Made:

    Single letters are considered valid palindromes.


Time taken:

    2 - 2.5 hours.


Improvements I would make given more time:

    Improve logging - Use a logger, and log information to a file.
    Improve tests - Test the persistence to file.
